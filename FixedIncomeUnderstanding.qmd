## What are Bonds?

Bonds are financial instruments that represent a collection of future cashflows. These cashflows will be $N \geq 0$ "coupon payments" and one payment of the principle or "par" value. For example, should an investor purchase a 5 year \$100 5% Treasury bond "at par value", and suppose the bond pays coupons semi-annually, she would be entitled to receive 10 coupon payments of \$2.5 every six months and one payment of \$100 at the end of 5 years.

## Bond Valuation

Assuming no credit risk, the price of a bond is the sum of the present values of

# Payment Frequency

## Yield

## Duration

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
